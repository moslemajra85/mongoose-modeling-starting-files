##Transaction
Transactions are useful when you need to make multiple changes to the database
at once and want to ensure either all changes are saved or none are, to keep 
your data consistent.

#Scenario
Letâ€™s say you have two collections:

User: stores user information with a balance.
Order: stores orders placed by users.

You want to create an order only if the user has enough balance. If any part of the 
process fails (like deducting the balance or saving the order),
neither action should be saved to keep the data consistent.
